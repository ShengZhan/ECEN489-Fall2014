Hello,

Early in the semester, you will be given a series of tasks.  These tasks are aimed at making sure that your programming platform features the necessary software for our work.  Tasks are an integral part of the progression of the course, and they are the easiest points to collect.  In the process, we will leverage these straightforward exercises to get familiar with peer grading.

You will find attached to this email Task 1, which focuses on transforming your laptop into a world class programming environment.  Some of you may have the required software already installed.  In such cases, you may only need to bring it up to date.  Programming exercises will eventually be submitted as CMake projects.  This is instrumental in facilitating peer grading and cooperative initiatives.  As such, CMake is a requirement, not an option.  Task 1 is the starting point of your journey, and it should be completed promptly.  The EIC offers very fast wireless access to download the necessary packages, so you may want to perform this task in class.  The software packages are free, yet they can be quite large.

Best regards,
Jean-Francois Chamberland and Gregory Huff

Due Date: Sep 3 (tentative); Sep 5 (definitely).
