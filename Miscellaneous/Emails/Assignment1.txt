Dear Students,

You will find attached to this email Assignment 1 and Opt-Out Challenge 1.  The first assignment should be rather straightforward.  It is acceptable to write your answers directly on the question sheet.  Alternatively, you may elect to hand in your work separately.  In any case, you must submit a printed version of the question sheet, as it will be used to grade your solution. In addition, you will need to submit your code and CMake file through GitHub.

Cheers,
Jean-Francois Chamberland, Gregory Huff
